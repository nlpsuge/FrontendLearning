[Mutter (software) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutter_(software))


Mutter is a window manager initially designed and implemented for the X Window System, but then evolved to be a Wayland compositor. It became the default window manager in GNOME 3, replacing Metacity[5] which used GTK for rendering.

Mutter can function as a standalone window manager for GNOME-like desktops, and serves as the primary window manager for the GNOME Shell,[6] which is an integral part of GNOME 3.

GNOME Shell is written as a plug-in to Mutter.
