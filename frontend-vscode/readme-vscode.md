# How to use VS Code? ðŸ˜‚

Yeah! Sometimes, it's so so so annoying that I can't find the right option, the menu provided by vscode itself is too simple.

# Show All Commands

- Help -> Show All Commands
- Press `Ctrl + n` or `Shift + Shift` then type `>`
- `Ctrl + Shift + A`

# Convert selected text to `upper`/`lower`/`camel` case
Type `case` in `Show All Commands`, then you should see those options.
